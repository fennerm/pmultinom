\usage{
pmultinom(q, n, prob, log.p = FALSE, lower.tail = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{Vector of quantiles; If q has length 1 then the same quantile is
used for each bin. If q is length k, each bin is assigned its own
quantile}

\item{n}{Total number of balls}

\item{prob}{A vector of length k, describing the probability of a ball being
placed into bin xk}

\item{log.p}{If TRUE, natural logarithm of probability is returned
(Default: FALSE)}

\item{lower.tail}{logical; if TRUE, probabilities are P[X <= x],
otherwise, P[X > x] (Default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
Numeric; A probability value. Returns the string "<2.2e-16" for
        extremely small probabilities
}
\description{
Multinomial CDF

i.e. If n balls are thrown into k bins, calculate
P(x1<=q1, x2<=q2, ..., xk<=qk) where xi are numbers of balls in each bin, and
qi are quantiles
Uses an approximation described in: \cr

\examples{
# For 4 balls randomly thrown into 2 bins, probability that all bins end up
# with 2 or fewer balls
pmultinom(q = 2, n = 4, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))

# For 6 balls randomly thrown into 3 bins, probability that at least one bin
# ends up with 3 or more balls
pmultinom(q = 2, n = 6, c(1/3, 1/3, 1/3))

# Same as above, but with different probabilities for each bin
pmultinom(q = 2, n = 6, c(0.2, 0.3, 0.5), lower.tail = FALSE)

# For 4 balls randomly thrown into 2 bins, probability that the first bin has
# 0 balls and the second bin has 4
pmultinom(q = c(0, 4), n = 4, c(0.5, 0.5), lower.tail = FALSE)
